                    <p> The cryptocurrency market is overwhelmed with altcoins. Hence, investing in crypto is confusing because most of the tokens are cheaper now. Which one should you choose?  </p>
                    <p> Selecting the right token is the first and the most critical step in the crypto investment journey.  </p>
                    <p> You can buy the token at an initial stage to enjoy maximum benefits of price appreciation in future. Whereas it is risky too, when you failed to choose the right token at right time.</p>
                    <p> You need to analyze the features of the token, utility, transparency, legal terms and condition, and anticipation of future demand. The total number of available tokens and the market circulating supply of the tokens offered to public are also important aspects.  </p>
                    <p> Accordingly, TechnoSavvy token is one of the best token currently available in the market. We will now take a closer look at the TechnoSavvy Token and comprehend why you should be an early bird investor in TechnoSavvy Token. </p>

                    <h3> What is TechnoSavvy Token?  </h3>
                    <p> TechnoSavvy Token is an ERC-20 utility token designed to serve as the native Token of the TechnoApp trading ecosystem. TechnoApp is a positive cashback centralized cryptocurrency exchange that provides trading and investing in crypto. </p>
                    <p> The primary aim of the project is to reduce the total cost of trade and offer positive cash back for trade at TechnoApp exchange. The project will launch in coming weeks. </p>

                    <h3> Why value of TechnoSavvy Token is predicted to surge?  </h3>
                    <p> The launch of TechnoApp exchange will create a revolutionary change in the trading and investing of crypto tokens. As cited earlier, TechnoSavvy Token is the only token that facilitate TechnoApp crypto exchange with all the exceptional features, which is why TechnoSavvy’s value will explode in the future. </p>

The following facts prove that TechnoSavvy token is one of the top cryptocurrencies that can give maximum benefits to investors.  </p>

                    <h4 class="sub-head-text"> 1. Fixed Supply Value Variance Inflationary Token  </h4>
                    <p> One of the most critical characteristics of TechnoSavvy Token is its fixed supply. The total planned supply of TechnoSavvy is limited to 112.5 Billion tokens, among which 100 billion tokens are locked at TechnoApp exchange for exchange activities. On top of that, only 50 Million (0.04%) is available for public sale. </p>
                    <p> There will not be any further addition of tokens in the future under the current plan. Consequently, the demand for the token and market capitalization will eventually increase. The same can boost the token price in a short-term period making TechnoSavvy Token one of the top cryptocurrencies in the world. </p>
                    <p> Initial investors receive additional benefits for staking on the exchange. This encourages staking TechnoSavvy Token, decreases freely available tokens in the market, and increases demand. The process, in turn, leads to additional value enhancement in TechnoSavvy Token. </p>

                    <h4 class="sub-head-text"> 2. Continuous Capital Appreciation </h4>
                    <p> Price of a cryptocurrency token depends on its demand and its circulating supply. TechnoApp trading mechanism is designed in such a way that every transaction creates additional demand in tokens. Here is how </p>
                    <ul class="blog-li">
                        <li> The whole TechnoSavvy transaction happens only through TechnoApp exchange. Every transaction can appreciate TechnoSavvy Token’s price. </li>
                        <li> All the trading pairs are routed through TechnoSavvy token. It will increase demand, and the crypto pair trading value will create a capital appreciation for the token. </li>
                        <li> The capital appreciation benefit will encourage investors to invest more. This will further contribute to token price growth. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> It doesn't matter what the cost of asset trading is or what the market situation in crypto is, the price of TechnoSavvy Token gets increased for all transactions.  </p>

                    <h4 class="sub-head-text">3. Positive Cashback  </h4>
                    <p> Every user is valued at TechnoApp next-generation exchange. TechnoApp offers positive cashback to it’s community members to increase market participation (i.e., encourage for investment and trading in crypto). Traders can avail of up to 0.10% of the transaction volume as cashback. This supports TechnoSavvy token in two ways.  </p>
                    <p> Positive cashback encourages more users, enhancing the total trading volume in the exchange, which will, in turn, add to the capital appreciation of TechnoSavvy. </p>

                    <h4 class="sub-head-text">4. Limited Public Sale Availability </h4>
                    <p> As mentioned earlier, only 0.04% of the total supply is available for public sale. That is 50 million tokens. </p>
                    <p> Since it is the only native utility token for TechnoApp exchange trading activities, each settled transaction contribute in TechnoSavvy’s price appreciation. The limited availability anticipates a massive demand for tokens in the upcoming days.  </p>

                    <h4 class="sub-head-text">5. Distinctive Working Mechanism of TechnoApp Exchange </h4>
                    <p> One of the significant issues of cryptocurrency exchange is higher transaction fees. TechnoApp exchange is entitled to provide cashback rewards of up to 0.05% of the transaction value instead of charging transaction fees. The positive cashback system encourages traders for crypto trading. </p>
                    <p> Ultimately traders are getting paid for the crypto transaction, which is the significant reason the TechnoApp exchange envisions unprecedented growth in the future.

                    <h4 class="sub-head-text"> 7. Circumvent Limitations on the Liquidity Pool  </h4>
                    <p> The slippage of the token value is a major concern when buying a token with a low market cap. The risk is high during higher market volatility and less volume availability for large orders. </p>
                    <p> TechnoSavvy overcomes the limitation of the liquidity pool through the tokenomics and working mechanism. Because cashback encourages users to trade at TechnoApp, trading volume will always be on the higher side. </p>
                    <p> Low impact cost and high cashback rewards can ensure a high velocity of TechnoSavvy Token. The working mechanism and nature of the token overcome the existing liquidity pool limitations of other tokens. </p>

                    <h4 class="sub-head-text"> 8. Zero Transaction Fees </h4>
                    <p> TechnoApp Crypto Exchange offers zero transaction fees on trades.

                    </p>
