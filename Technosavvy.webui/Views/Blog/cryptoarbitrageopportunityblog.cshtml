                    <h3>What is Arbitrage Trading? </h3>
                    <p>In the crypto market, Arbitrage is one of the most popular trading methods to generate profit. In Crypto Arbitrage Trading, traders exploit the opportunity of price differentiation in various exchanges.   </p>
                    <p>In layman's language, Arbitrage trading is buying a crypto asset at a lower price on a crypto exchange and selling it on another exchange at a higher price. Several factors contribute to price differentiation, such as Liquidity, Demand and Supply of that particular token. </p>

                            <tr>
                                <td>A </td>
                                <td>$39,999  </td>
                                <td>$40,000  </td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>B </td>
                                <td> $40,010   </td>
                                <td>$40,020   </td>
                            </tr>
                           
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                    <p>On exchange A the buy and sell price is 39,999 USDT and 40,000 USDT, respectively, whereas on exchange B, it is 40,010 USDT & 40,020 USDT, respectively. </p>
                    <p>Jess finds an arbitrage opportunity between these exchanges.To grab the arbitrage opportunity, the trader sells BTC at Exchange B $40,010 & Buys at Exchange A $40,000 and makes an arbitrage profit of $10. Assuming the transaction fee of Exchange A & B is 0.1% (minimum exchange fees for current generation exchange) per side, she had to incur the trading fee of $80 to complete both the transaction </p>
                    <p>Therefore, the net loss came out as $70. </p>
                    <p>The next day, she came across our platform TechnoApp. She understands every trade at TechnoApp is empowered by the TechnoSavvy token, and TechnoApp offers a positive cashback of up to 0.10% of the transaction value where the buy rate was 39,999 USDT, and the sell rate was 40,000 USDT  </p>
                    <p> The transaction fee at TechnoApp is zero </p>
                    <p>Jess buys at TechnoApp  $40,000 and sells  $39,999. Now you may say the trade was executed on a loss of $1.  </p>
                    <h6> But is it? Let’s see! </h6>
                    <p>She earns ($40,000 + 39,999) *0.10% = $79.999 worth of TechnoSavvy Token in return as cashback. </p>
                    <p>She effectively made an arbitrage profit of $78.999~ ($79.999-$1), while at the other cryptocurrency exchange, she faced an inevitable loss. </p>
                    <p>The cashback Bonus benefit at TechnoApp is never less than the trading fees. Therefore, it is always cash positive for the traders. At TechnoApp, traders will always have an additional edge over other traders to generate maximum profit. </p>
