                    <p>TechnoSavvy is the native utility token of the next-generation cryptocurrency exchange, TechnoApp. The lauch price of the TechnoSavvy token is 1.60 USDT. which is expected to grow with each trade on the platfrom as each trade will contribute to the value appreciation of the token, which means the TechnoSavvy floor price is fixed and expected to grow above that point. In this article, we will learn about the TechnoApp ecosystem and how it ensures continuous capital appreciation. </p>
                    <h3>TechnoSavvy: The Value Variance Inflationary Token </h3>
                    <p>TechnoApp has a unique trading mechanism. It requires TechnoSavvy to settle every trade. All the trades on the exchange are routed through TechnoSavvy Token, which creates a consistent demand for the token.  </p>
                    <p> Let’s understand it through an example:</p>
                    <p>Assuming you want to buy BTC using USDT. Your USDT will first buy TechnoSavvy of the equivalent amount, and then it will be used to settle the trade i.e., Buy BTC. </p>
                    <p>Further, as per the Tokenomics of the project, TechnoSavvy has a limited supply of 112.5 billion, out of which only 26 million will be available in the open market, and 100 billion will be locked in the TechnoApp ecosystem for the smooth functioning of the trading mechanism. </p>
                    <p>The equation of consistent demand and limited supply leads to the continuous price appreciation of TechnoSavvy Token. Thus, it is also called a value variance inflationary token, which means after each settled trade, the price of TechnoSavvy will change from its previous price at an increasing rate.  </p>
                    <p>Also, because of the limited supply of TechnoSavvy tokens in the open market, no outside market forces will be able to negatively influence the price of TechnoSavvy Token. It implicitly means the price movement for the native utility token of TechnoApp will largely depend on the trade activity on the exchange.  </p>
                    <h3>TechnoApp Ecosystem</h3>
                    <p>TechnoApp is the next-generation crypto exchange. It aims to provide the world’s most rewarding trading experience to all its community members. The exchange provides a no-cost trading platform and cashback rewards on each trade.  </p>

                    <h3>TechnoSavvy – A Value Variance Inflationary Token </h3>
                    <p>TechnoSavvy is the underlying currency of TechnoApp, a cryptocurrency exchange that offers a unique and innovative approach to the crypto market. </p>
                    <p>The value of TechnoSavvy is determined by the traded pair value of all the trades that happen on the TechnoApp platform.  </p>
                    <p>As the trading volume and value on the exchange increase, the value of TechnoSavvy will also increase. </p>
                    <p>Let’s understand it, how? </p>
                    <p>All the transactions on TechnoApp will route through TechnoSavvy token itself. For example, if you want to buy 0.1 BTC for 220 USDT. Your USDT will first buy TechnoSavvy token on the platform, and then the required TechnoSavvy will be used to buy BTC.   </p>
                    <p>This will create a consistent demand for the TechnoSavvy token. Further, as per Tokenomics, the demand for TechnoSavvy is limited. The equation of consistent demand and limited supply will ensure the appreciation in value with each trade.  </p>
                    <p>In other words, TechnoSavvy encapsulates the traded pair value of all the trades that happen on the TechnoApp platform, providing a unique way to appreciate the invested capital. </p>
                    <p>This feature makes TechnoSavvy a dynamic currency that reflects the overall activity and performance of the TechnoApp exchange. </p>
                    <p>By holding TechnoSavvy, TechnoApp community members can benefit from the growth of the exchange. </p>
                    <p>TechnoApp platform uses a unique algorithm called Automated Market Maker (AMM) to calculate the price of TechnoSavvy after each settled trade. AMM is popularly used in DEX. However, TechnoApp will be using it to determine the price of TechnoSavvy despite being CEX. This algorithm takes into account the traded pair value of all the trades on the exchange and adjusts the value of the token accordingly. This means that the value of TechnoSavvy token is constantly changing based on the activity on TechnoApp platform and the price of the token will appreciate each time a trade will be executed on the exchange. Thus, it is called a value variance inflationary token. </p>
                    <p>This also means each time a trade is executed on TechnoApp, the trading volume on the exchange will be about 2X the trading value imitated by traders as the TechnoApp trading engine will process the trade for TechnoSavvy token as well. </p>
                    <h3>TechnoApp, The Exchange for The Future </h3>
