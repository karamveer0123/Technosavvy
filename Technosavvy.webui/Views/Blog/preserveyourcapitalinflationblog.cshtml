                    <p>With rising inflation, it becomes difficult for people to preserve the value of money. Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money. As time passes, the same amount of money will buy less than it did before.   </p>
                    <p>This can make it difficult for people to plan for the future and invest in growth, as there will be uncertainty about how much their costs will increase. Additionally, if the rate of inflation is higher than the rate of return on investments, it can also cause a decrease in the value of invested capital. Thus, an investor should opt for an investment that can outperform inflation. Though multiple assets are available, cryptocurrencies can be an incredible asset to park your money, enabling you to not only outperform inflation but also generate massive wealth.   </p>
                    <p>In this article, we will discuss what inflation is, how it impacts your money, and TechnoSavvy token can help you preserve your capital value.   </p>
                    <h3>What is Inflation, and How Does it Affect Your Money?  </h3>
                    <p>Inflation is a measure of the increase in prices for goods and services over a certain period of time. It is measured by calculating the rate of change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or Producer Price Index (PPI).  </p>
                    <p>In a layman's language, inflation is when prices for goods and services go up over time. The same amount of money you have today will not buy as much in the future. For example, if one-liter milk cost $1 today, but next year it costs $1.10, that is inflation. This increase in prices can make it harder for you to afford things you need and can decrease the value of your savings over time.  </p>
                    <p>Inflation can have a major effect on your money in various ways, some of which have been included below:   </p>
                    <h3>Decreasing the value of savings  </h3>
                    <p>When prices rise, the same amount of money will buy less than it did before. This can make it more difficult for people to plan for their financial future. Inflation can erode the value of savings over time, which means that cash savings will lose purchasing power. For example, if inflation is running at 2% per year, then $100 today will be equivalent to having $98 in terms of purchasing power.  </p>
                    <h3>Increasing the cost of living  </h3>
                    <p>Inflation can make it more expensive for you to purchase essential goods and services, such as food and housing. As prices increase, your money doesn't go as far as it used to. This can be especially challenging for people on fixed incomes, such as retirees or even employees working on a fixed rate of remuneration, who may have difficulty keeping up with rising costs.  </p>
                    <h3>Making it more difficult to plan for retirement  </h3>
                    <p>Inflation can decrease the value of investments and savings, making it more difficult for people to save for retirement. The higher rate of inflation means more money you will need to save to maintain your standard of living once you retire. Thus, it is important you strategically choose your investment that can beat inflation by a significant margin.   </p>
                    <h3>Decreasing real wages  </h3>
                    <p>When inflation is higher than wage growth, it can lead to a decrease in purchasing power for workers. This means that even if wages are increasing, they may not be keeping pace with rising prices, leading to a decrease in real wages.  </p>
                    <h3>Increasing interest rates  </h3>
                    <p>To control inflation, central banks may raise interest rates, which can make it more expensive for individuals and businesses to borrow money. Higher interest rates can also lead to a decrease in consumer spending and economic growth.  </p>
                    <h3>TechnoSavvy, The Hedge Against Inflation  </h3>
