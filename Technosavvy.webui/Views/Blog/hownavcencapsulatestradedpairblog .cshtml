                    <h3>TechnoSavvy – A Value Variance Inflationary Token </h3>
                    <p>TechnoSavvy is the underlying currency of TechnoApp, a cryptocurrency exchange that offers a unique and innovative approach to the crypto market. </p>
                    <p>The value of TechnoSavvy is determined by the traded pair value of all the trades that happen on the TechnoApp platform.  </p>
                    <p>As the trading volume and value on the exchange increase, the value of TechnoSavvy will also increase. </p>
                    <p>Let’s understand it, how? </p>
                    <p>All the transactions on TechnoApp will route through TechnoSavvy token itself. For example, if you want to buy 0.1 BTC for 220 USDT. Your USDT will first buy TechnoSavvy token on the platform, and then the required TechnoSavvy will be used to buy BTC.   </p>
                    <p>This will create a consistent demand for the TechnoSavvy token. Further, as per Tokenomics, the demand for TechnoSavvy is limited. The equation of consistent demand and limited supply will ensure the appreciation in value with each trade.  </p>
                    <p>In other words, TechnoSavvy encapsulates the traded pair value of all the trades that happen on the TechnoApp platform, providing a unique way to appreciate the invested capital. </p>
                    <p>This feature makes TechnoSavvy a dynamic currency that reflects the overall activity and performance of the TechnoApp exchange. </p>
                    <p>By holding TechnoSavvy, TechnoApp community members can benefit from the growth of the exchange. </p>
                    <p>TechnoApp platform uses a unique algorithm called Automated Market Maker (AMM) to calculate the price of TechnoSavvy after each settled trade. AMM is popularly used in DEX. However, TechnoApp will be using it to determine the price of TechnoSavvy despite being CEX. This algorithm takes into account the traded pair value of all the trades on the exchange and adjusts the value of the token accordingly. This means that the value of TechnoSavvy token is constantly changing based on the activity on TechnoApp platform and the price of the token will appreciate each time a trade will be executed on the exchange. Thus, it is called a value variance inflationary token. </p>
                    <p>This also means each time a trade is executed on TechnoApp, the trading volume on the exchange will be about 2X the trading value imitated by traders as the TechnoApp trading engine will process the trade for TechnoSavvy token as well. </p>
                    <h3>TechnoApp, The Exchange for The Future </h3>

                    <p>The benefit of cashback rewards and a no-cost trading platform will attract more traders to trade on the platform resulting in deep liquidity for the listed cryptocurrency. It will ensure faster trade settlement at the most adequate prices. This will further encourage traders to trade more on the world’s most rewarding crypto exchange and earn more & more cashback rewards, resulting in a high velocity of the TechnoSavvy token. Which will eventually appreciate the value of the TechnoSavvy token.   </p>
                    <p>To further ensure the limited supply of TechnoSavvy in the market, TechnoSavvy holders will get the added benefit of increased cashback rewards which will further create the demand for the token.
