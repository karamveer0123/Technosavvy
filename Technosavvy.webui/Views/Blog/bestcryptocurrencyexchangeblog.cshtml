                    <p>Whether you're new to the market or even an expert, you must be aware of how even a small percentage of fees can reduce your profit to a significant extent.

                     <h3> Zero Trading Charges    </h3>

                    <p>A liquid market is the desire of the traders. A highly liquid market enables traders to trade easily and ensure faster trade settlement and the most relevant price. The liquidity of a crypto exchange depends on the number of traders it has on the platform. The higher the number of traders, the higher the liquidity will be. Zero transaction fees and cashback rewards will encourage traders and investors to participate more in the TechnoApp trading ecosystem, which will create augmented liquidity on the TechnoApp crypto exchange.  </p>
