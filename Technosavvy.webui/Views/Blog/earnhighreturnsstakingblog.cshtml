                    <p> Previously, earning crypto was limited to buying and selling the tokens to generate profit or get rewards for mining the blocks. Now, with the rising number of crypto adoptions comes numerous money-making opportunities.  </p>
                    <p>One of the ways through which you can generate high ROI is Staking Crypto.   </p>

                    <h3>What is Crypto Staking?  </h3>
                    <p> Staking means locking up your crypto tokens for a certain period to get desired ROV and lucrative rewards, such as cashback and discounts on certain goods and services. </p>
                    <p>Various blockchain projects such as Ethereum use Proof of Stake as their consensus mechanism to validate the transactions. People participating in the network stake their crypto tokens to get selected as validators to earn rewards. The more tokens you deposit in the pool, the higher the chances of getting selected as a validator. All the participants who willingly lock up their tokens get rewarded to participate in the network. </p>
                    <p>However, staking your TechnoSavvy differs from what you read above. TechnoApp encourages investors to stake its native utility token to ensure they get the maximum price appreciation benefits.  </p>
                    <p> TechnoSavvy is the native utility token of the next-generation exchange, TechnoApp. TechnoSavvy offers capital appreciation benefits by encapsulating the traded pair value on the exchange, and the price of TechnoSavvy rises each time a trade is executed on the exchange. </p>
