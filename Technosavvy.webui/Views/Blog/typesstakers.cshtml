                    </p>
                    <p>

                        TechnoSavvy Utility on TechnoApp
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        TechnoSavvy is the bloodline of TechnoApp Crypto Exchange. As mentioned above, it acts as the underlying currency of the exchange. The Automated Market Maker (AMM) ensures that all the transactions happening on the exchange pass through the TechnoSavvy token itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The total token supply is locked at 112.5 billion. Out of which, only 0.02% will be available to trade in the open market, and 88.9% will be locked in TechnoApp for the smooth functioning of the trade engine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The equation of limited supply and consistent demand will lead to the value appreciation for the token. It is a unique utility of TechnoSavvy Token on the exchange, which will ensure a high token velocity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The more you trade on the platform, the higher your capital appreciation will be. Thus, your participation in the TechnoApp trading ecosystem will add value to the TechnoSavvy Token.
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        What is Staking?
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Staking is a process in the cryptocurrency world where users hold their digital assets in a designated wallet for a certain period of time to support the network's operations. In return, they receive rewards. On TechnoApp, you can get increased cashback rewards and enjoy capital appreciation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Staking has become a popular trend among cryptocurrency traders as it provides several benefits. Firstly, staking allows traders to earn passive income by holding their assets in a wallet and supporting the network's operations. This can provide a steady source of income without the need for active trading. Additionally, if you stake your TechnoSavvy Tokens on TechnoApp, you can get a cashback reward of up to 0.1% of the total transaction value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another benefit of staking is that it increases the value of the cryptocurrency tokens being held. As more users stake their tokens, their demand increases, leading to a rise in their market value. Furthermore, staking can also help traders avoid the risk of price volatility associated with actively trading their tokens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By staking TechnoSavvy tokens, traders can contribute to the growth and development of the TechnoApp trading ecosystem while simultaneously benefiting from the rewards provided by the platform.
