        identifiers. Identifiers are of two types: a.) Primary and b.) Secondary.</p>
        <ul class="li-bullet li-bullet-2">
          <li><strong> Primary Identifiers: </strong>Means and includes the Name (in full), Date of Birth, Tax Identity Number, and Passport Number/Voter Identity Card/Driving License as they help in uniquely establishing the identity of the person.</li>
          <li><strong> Secondary Identifiers: </strong>Includes Address, Location, Nationality, and other such identification, as they help further refine the identity. User identification does not start and end at the point of application but it is always an ongoing exercise. </li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="simple-text">6.1.2 What is Identification?</h5>
        <p>Identification is the act of establishing who a person is:</p>
        <ul class="li-bullet li-bullet-2">
          <li> In the context of KYC, identification means establishing who a person purport to be.</li>
          <li> This is done by recording the information provided by the User covering the elements of his identity (i.e., name, and the  address at which they can be located).</li>
          <li> For undertaking CDD, the following shall be obtained from an individual while establishing a relationship. The features to be verified and the documents to be obtained for establishing the identity of a person are as under:</li>        
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>i. Tax Identification Document, and</li>
          <li>ii. Certified copy of an Officially Valid Document (OVD) or the equivalent e-document thereof
          containing the details of identity and address.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="simple-text">6.1.3 What is Verification?</h5>
        <p>Verification of identity is the process of proving whether a person actually is who they claim to be. In
        the context of KYC, verification is the process of seeking satisfactory evidence of the identity of those
        with whom TechnoApp does business. This is done by carrying out checks on the correctness of the information
        provided by the customer.</p>
        <h5 class="simple-text">6.1.4 Process of video-KYC</h5>
        <p>In scenarios where the document provided by a User has some issues and cannot be validated using the
        automated solutions TechnoApp has in place, a video-KYC might be required from the User to validate the
        identity and authenticity of the document/ information submitted by them. We would also use the video-KYC
        process while performing enhanced due diligence wherever required.</p>
        <h5 class="simple-text">6.1.5 Periodic updation of KYC</h5>
        <p>Periodic updation of KYC of Users is performed at such intervals of time and using such
        processes/documents as decided by TechnoApp at its sole discretion. A risk-based approach for periodic
        updation of KYC is to be adopted:</p>
        
        <ul class="li-bullet li-bullet-2">
          <li><strong> No change in KYC information: </strong>In case of no change in the KYC information, a self-declaration from the User in this regard shall be obtained through user's email id and mobile number registered with TechnoApp.</li>
          <li><strong> Change in address: </strong>In case of a change only in the address details of the user, a self-declaration of the new address may be obtained from the user through the user's email id and mobile number registered with TechnoApp along with valid proof to be submitted by the user for the change in such address.</li>
          <li><strong> Change in contact information like a phone number or email address: </strong>In case of a change in the contact details of the user, the user can reach out to TechnoApp to get the details updated, along with valid proof of change and demonstrating ownership of the Account for which the details are to be updated.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5 class="simple-text">6.2 Types of CDD </h5>
        <p>There are 2 types of Customer Due Diligence (CDD) that can be used in accordance with the risk category
        of the customer.</p>
        <h3> <strong> 6.2.1 - Basic Due Diligence </strong> means the collection and verification of identity proof,
          address proof, and a photograph to establish the identity of the User. This is done on the basis of the
          documents and information submitted by the user. </h3>
        <h3> <strong> 6.2.2 - Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) </strong> means additional diligence measures undertaken
          over and above the Basic Due Diligence. Steps under EDD shall include but will not be limited to
          checking if a User falls under the category of Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), or is associated with
          any terrorist activities/groups, monitoring the account activity of such users, etc. </h3>        
        <p>TechnoApp shall conduct Basic Due Diligence, EDD, or any other due diligence activity or measures which
        under its sole discretion and/ or under Applicable Laws is required for a User registering or using the
        Platform.</p>
