                    <p> Is it safe to trade cryptocurrency? A common question that comes to our mind before entering the market. Indeed, it is an important question. When staking your hard-earned money, you need to consider security checks. </p>
                    <p> Cryptocurrency is a relatively new asset class. Thus, an adequate regulatory framework is absent. Further, extreme volatility, lack of liquidity and increased cyber-attacks and scams make it skeptical investment. However, it is also a place where people have generated enormous wealth. Following the right strategy and taking the required precaution can reduce the likelihood of incurring losses. </p>
                    
                    <h3> Rising Cryptocurrency Adoption </h3>
                    <p> The first-ever block of the bitcoin network was mined in the year 2009. The revolutionizing technology behind cryptocurrency shows the true face of democracy. No central authority has unrestricted powers. Transparency and Decentralization are vital pillars of this new-age technology, Blockchain. </p>
                    <p> After bitcoin, many altcoins have come into existence. Some of them touched the sky in terms of growth and others didn’t get the mass adoption. The reason is simple, token utility and potential growth. </p>
                    <p> Bitcoin, the pioneer in the industry has gained the community’s trust and has proved its authority in the last 10 years. </p>
                    <p> Considering its potential, renowned companies like Microsoft, AT&T, Burger King, Subway and Virgin Galactic have started accepting bitcoin as a payment method. </p>
                    <p> According to the experts, the crypto industry is still at its nascent stage and is likely to grow 3 times by 2030. The research shows a lucrative future and a tempting opportunity to trade and make unexpectedly high profits. </p>
                    <p> As mentioned above, we’re still at an early stage of crypto adoption making it skeptical too. The question arises, “Is it safe to Trade Crypto?” </p>

                    <h3> Is It Safe to Trade Cryptocurrency? </h3>
                    <p> Crypto is known for its volatility. Cryptocurrencies are the riskiest but most lucrative asset class. In 2021, Bitcoin and Ethereum gave a return of 59.8% and 399.2%, respectively, which can’t even be imagined in traditional investments like stocks, commodities, debt funds or bonds. </p>
                    <p> Despite giving unimaginable returns, the crypto market is subject to market risk. There are several reasons for the same such as: </p>
                    <p><strong> Lack of regulatory framework: </strong> Unlike stock market, crypto is not regulated and it is difficult to recover the lost money. Though, with the rising crypto community, the government has started establishing regulatory compliance around cryptocurrency. Some of the largest economies in the world, such as US, UK, Russia, Japan, and India, are seriously studying the subject to establish a robust legal framework. </p>
                    <p><strong> Market volatility: </strong> Bitcoin has lost even 50% of its value in a day. Though the crypto market can yield astonishing returns, the volatile nature makes it the riskiest asset class too. Bitcoin is the most renowned cryptocurrency, but there are examples of altcoins too which have gone to even zero. Thus, it is important you invest and trade in digital assets after thorough research. </p>
                    <p><strong> Vulnerable to Cyber Attacks: </strong> Since its inception crypto industry has witnessed multiple scams, hacks, and cyber-attacks. Especially exchanges and landing projects have gone through various cyber-attack where traders and investors did lose millions of dollars. As per the study by CNN, $1.9 billion worth of crypto has been stolen in the first 7 months of this year. </p>
                    <p><strong> Liquidity crunch on the exchange: </strong> Liquidity means how easily a crypto asset can be bought or sold. Crypto exchanges face liquidity crises when there is a smaller number of buyers and sellers on the platform. Traders and investors sometimes incur huge losses because of the liquidity crunch. Thus, it is important you choose your exchange wisely, which has the potential to cope-up the liquidity crises. TechnoApp is the Next-Generation crypto exchange offering an extensive liquidity pool. </p>
                    <p> Considering all the potential risks mentioned above, you need to frame a trading strategy based on your risk appetite and market condition. By implementing the right strategy, you can save yourself from the probable crypto trading losses and maximize your profit. </p>
