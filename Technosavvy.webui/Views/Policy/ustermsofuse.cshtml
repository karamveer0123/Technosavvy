In that query, you must provide your Customer Service ticket number, state the cause of your complaint, how you would like us to resolve the complaint, and any other information you believe to be relevant. Without a Customer Service ticket, your complaint will be deemed premature and will not receive a response. Upon receiving your complaint, we will open a support ticket and a user complaint officer (“Complaint Officer”) will review your complaint. The Complaint Officer will review your complaint without prejudice, based on the information you provided and any information we may derive from our records. Within thirty business days ((all days excluding Saturday, Sundays, and any bank holiday) (“Business Days”)) of our receipt of your complaint, the Complaint Officer will use reasonable efforts to address the points raised in your complaint and the Complaint Officer may: (1) offer to resolve your complaint in the way you have requested; (2) reject your complaint and set out the reasons for the rejection; or (3) offer to resolve your complaint with an alternative proposal or solution. In exceptional circumstances, if the Complaint Officer is unable to respond to your complaint within thirty Business Days, the Complaint Officer will use reasonable efforts to send you a holding response indicating the reasons for a delay in answering your complaint and specifying the deadline by which the Complaint Officer will respond to your complaint. </h3>
        <h3><strong> Offers: </strong> Any offer of resolution made to you will only become binding on TechnoApp if accepted by you. An offer of resolution will not constitute any admission by us of wrongdoing or liability regarding the complaint’s subject matter. </h3>

        <h2 id="arbitration"> Arbitration </h2>
        <p> If we cannot resolve your dispute through the complaint process, you agree that any dispute or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the TechnoApp Services, including, but not limited to, legal and equitable claims, federal and state statutory claims, common law claims, and those based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, shall be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual basis. Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). In agreeing to this binding commitment to arbitrate your claims, you agree that you waive any right to proceed in a court of law or to have your claims heard by a jury. The arbitration shall: (1) be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator in the English language; (2) be held virtually and not in person for all proceedings related to the arbitration, except by mutual agreement of all parties; and (3) be limited to one deposition per party, except by mutual agreement of all parties or upon a showing of need. Furthermore, in cases where neither party’s claim(s) or counterclaim(s) exceed $500, both parties agree to waive an arbitration hearing and resolve the dispute solely through submissions of documents to the arbitrator. The AAA rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at adr.org. </p>
        <p> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (“Notice”). The Notice must: (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought. We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or TechnoApp may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or TechnoApp shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law. </p>
