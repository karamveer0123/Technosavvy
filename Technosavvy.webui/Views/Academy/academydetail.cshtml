                for participating in the market. TechnoApp provides a seamless trading experience to the traders trading on
                the exchange with a smooth interface and next-generation features. </p>

              <h5 class="heading-5"> Settlement engine: </h5>
              <p> The Underlying algorithm used in TechnoApp Trading Engine ensures that TechnoSavvy Token is involved in every
                transaction that is being executed on this exchange. When the transaction is routed through TechnoSavvy, it
                creates the demand for the token. Increased demand and limited supply shot up the price of TechnoSavvy tokens.
              </p>

              <h5 class="heading-5"> Creating demand for TechnoSavvy </h5>
              <p> Collective demand of all tokens equals to demand of TechnoSavvy - TechnoSavvy is a value variance inflationary token
                and the price of this token appreciates each time a trade happens on TechnoApp because of the Automated
                Market Maker (AMM) Algorithm. Having zero transaction fees and positive cashback benefits will
                attract traders to trade on the exchange resulting in higher transactions. The utility of TechnoSavvy Token in
                the transactions happening on TechnoApp will increase the demand for TechnoSavvy Tokens. Because of its utility,
                unmatchable benefits, and rewards the TechnoSavvy demand will lead AMM to a continuous cycle of price
                increment. That is why it is called “Value Variance Inflationary Token”. </p>

              <p class="pt-4"> Cryptocurrency trading is the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies on an exchange. With us, you can trade cryptos by speculating on their price movements via CFDs (contracts for difference). </p>
              <p> CFDs are leveraged derivatives – meaning that you can trade cryptocurrency price movements without taking ownership of any underlying coins. When trading derivatives, you can go long (‘buy’) if you think a cryptocurrency will rise in value or go short (‘sell’) if you think it will fall. </p>
              <p> By contrast, when you buy cryptocurrencies on an exchange, you buy the coins themselves. You’ll need to create an exchange account, put up the full value of the asset to open a position, and store the cryptocurrency tokens in your own wallet until you’re ready to sell. </p>
              <p> Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. For traders using leveraged derivatives that allow for both long and short positions, large and sudden price movements present opportunities for profit. However, at the same time, these also increase your exposure to risk. In short, the more volatile the market, the more risk you carry when trading it. </p>

              <img src="../images/spot-trading.png" alt="image">
              <p class="pt-4"> In a spot market, traders can immediately exchange their cryptocurrency for fiat currency or another cryptocurrency by placing a buy or sell order. </p>
              <p> The base market, where crypto assets are instantaneously exchanged and settled, is known as a spot market, and trading in this market includes buying digital currencies like Bitcoin or other altcoins and holding them until their value rises. </p>
              <p> It is called spot trading because the transactions are settled “on the spot.” Furthermore, spot markets include sellers, buyers and order books. Sellers make an order with a specific ask or sell price, and buyers place an order for any cryptocurrency token with a particular bid or purchase price. The bid price is the highest price that a buyer is ready to pay, and the ask price is the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept as payment. </p>
              <p> The order book has two sides: The ask side for buyers eager to buy and the bid side for sellers willing to sell. The order book records bids and asks in the order book. For instance, in spot trading, if Bob makes an order to purchase BTC, this transaction will instantly go to the bid side of the order book. When a seller from the crypto spot trading platform is selling at the same specifications, this order is automatically filled. </p>
              <p> The transaction continues to the ask side of the order book when Bob enters an order to sell BTC in the above crypto spot trading example. The orders in green in the order book reflect purchasers of a specific token, while the orders in red represent sellers of that token </p>
              <p> The goal of spot trading is to buy low and sell high in order to make a profit, but it's not sure that this tactic will always work to the traders’ advantage considering the volatility of the crypto market. </p>
              <p> The spot price, trade date and settlement date are the three crucial concepts in spot trading. The current price of any asset is called the spot price, and the traders can sell assets under consideration immediately at this price. Additionally, one can buy or sell cryptocurrencies with other users on various exchange platforms. </p>
              <p> The spot price changes as new orders are placed and old ones are filled. The trade date initiates and records the transaction and represents the day the market actually carries out the trade. The assets involved in the transaction are actually transferred on the settlement date, also known as the spot date. </p>
              <p> Depending on the sort of market being traded, there may be one day or several days between the trade date and the settlement date. For cryptocurrency, it usually happens on the same day, though it may differ among exchanges or trading platforms. </p>
              <h5 class="heading-5"> Pros and cons of crypto spot trading </h5>
              <p> When you purchase an asset at the spot price, one truly becomes the asset owner, allowing traders to sell it or relocate it to offline storage as they like. In addition, spot trading enables traders to use their cryptocurrency assets for additional functions like online payments or staking. </p>
              <p> Moreover, spot trading is substantially less risky than margin trading, i.e., one can invest in crypto assets without worrying about losing money due to price changes and dealing with margin calls. As a result, the trader does not run the risk of contributing more of their own money or losing more money than they already have in their account because there are no margin calls. </p>
              <p> However, the biggest drawback of spot trading is that it does not offer the advantage of any potential return amplification that leverage in margin trading might provide. Moreover, due to the absence of leverage, potential gains in the spot market are lower than those in margin trading. </p>

                <li> Apart from these four pieces, color is the fifth piece of information that comes into play. The
                  color indicates whether the candle is rising or falling. </li>
                <li> You can also adjust the color depending on your preference. The default setting is a white
                  background, where green candles (with black borders to make them visible against a white background)
                  are up candles. In contrast, red candles are down candles, indicating a bearish market behavior. </li>
              </ul>
              <h5 class="heading-5"> Body and wick </h5>
              <p> The other important information is that each candle has its body and wick. the candle has the opening
                price at the top and closing price at the bottom. The opening and closing prices determine the
                boundaries of the candle body and its color. If the price has increased since the beginning of the
                analyzed period, the candle’s body is green with the opening price at the bottom and the closing price
                at the top. Alternatively, the candle is red if the price has fallen since the beginning of the analyzed
                period. On the other hand, the length of the upper and lower wicks is determined by the lowest and
                highest price values in the analyzed period. Traders use the candlestick charts to look for specific
                formations. </p>

If trader think that the current market price will quickly move against their favorable price, i.e., if they think price will move up anytime, and user wants to buy it irrespective of price limit, he will likely place Market Buy Order; if they think price will move down anytime, and user wants to sell it irrespective of price limit, he will likely place Market Sell Order.

                <h5 class="heading-5 pt-4"> Basic Definitions - </h5>
                <p>KYC refers to a process that banks and other financial institutions use to gather identifying data and
                  contact information from current and potential customers. Its purpose is to prevent fraud, money
                  laundering, and other illicit activity, as well as the misuse of financial accounts. KYC processes are
                  an industry standard for financial services and crypto exchanges. It’s one of the most important
                  functions in the fight against money laundering and other crimes. KYC checks can feel like an annoyance,
                  but they provide a great deal of security. As part of wider AML measures, KYC allows you to trade crypto
                  on exchanges like TechnoApp with more confidence and security.</p>
                <p> Some identifying documents required by KYC processes include: Driver’s License / Government-issued
                  photo ID, Passport, Social security number, PAN card, Voter ID Card </p>
                <h5 class="heading-5"> Why is KYC Mandatory for Most Crypto Exchanges? </h5>
                <p> Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations are mandatory for major cryptocurrency exchanges because it
                  ensures they comply with regulatory rules and laws. The goal of KYC is to curb illicit activities and to
                  highlight suspicious behavior as early as possible. Cryptocurrency exchanges utilize these data to track
                  transaction patterns to ensure safe and compliant transactions. Without KYC verification, a
                  cryptocurrency exchange may be held liable when a user gets away with committing a crime because they
                  failed to do due diligence. Henceforth, major exchanges prefer to remain anti-money laundering (AML)
                  compliant. However, KYC and AML, while sometimes related, do not refer to the same thing. </p>

                <p class="pt-4">AML - Anti-money laundering (AML) is a broad term for laws and regulations put in place to
                  prevent criminals from making money illegally or moving illicit funds. While many illegal activities are
                  targeted by AML laws, some of the most important are tax evasion, public corruption, and market
                  manipulation through methods such as wash trading. AML is tightly linked to Know Your Customer (KYC)
                  requirements, which essentially involve verifying customers' identities and the sources of their income.
                  KYC also requires financial institutions to monitor their users' activity on an ongoing basis. Like AML,
                  modern KYC procedures are heavily automated, and many institutions use the client onboarding process as
                  an opportunity to acquire proper identification from new customers. </p>

                          is initially crypto to crypto exchange, it could operate in almost every country worldwide –
                          unless the country have its own crypto oriented regulations. At press time, TechnoApp does not have
                          an official list of supported countries. The exchange continues to operate in several countries
                          in the America, Europe, Asia, and others. However, due to strict financial regulations globally,
                          TechnoApp has restricted its product offerings to customers in certain countries. </p>
