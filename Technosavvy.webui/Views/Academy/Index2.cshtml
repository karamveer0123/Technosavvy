                        <p> Cryptocurrency trading involves buying and selling cryptocurrencies on an exchange. At our platform, you can trade cryptocurrencies by speculating on their price movements via CFDs (contracts for difference). CFDs are leveraged derivatives, which means you can trade cryptocurrency price movements without taking ownership of any underlying coins.  </p>
                        <p>
                            When trading derivatives, you can go long ('buy') if you think a cryptocurrency will rise in value or go short ('sell') if you think it will fall. By contrast, when you buy cryptocurrencies on an exchange, you buy the coins themselves. This requires you to create an exchange account, put up the full value of the asset to open a position, and store the cryptocurrency tokens in your own wallet until you're ready to sell.

                        </p>
                        <p>Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, and for traders using leveraged derivatives that allow for both long and short positions, large and sudden price movements present opportunities for profit. However, at the same time, these movements also increase your exposure to risk. In short, the more volatile the market, the more risk you carry when trading it. </p>
                        <p>
                            When trading cryptocurrencies with us, you can access real-time pricing. We derive our prices from several exchanges, and they're calculated on a continuous basis. Our prices are reflective of the underlying market, and because they are based on real markets in real time, they always reflect actual market sentiment.

We also provide a secure platform that you can utilise measures such as the two-factor authentication (2FA) to ensure you're secure when trading online.

                        </p>
                        <p>In summary, trading cryptocurrencies with us via CFDs allows you to take advantage of the price movements of cryptocurrencies without the need to own the underlying assets.

However, it's essential to note that trading cryptocurrencies carry risks, and you should always ensure you understand the risks involved before you start trading. </p>

                        <p> Cryptocurrency trading is the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies on an exchange. With our platform, you can trade cryptocurrencies by speculating on their price movements via CFDs (contracts for difference). CFDs are leveraged derivatives, which means you can trade cryptocurrency price movements without taking ownership of any underlying coins.  </p>
                        <p> When trading derivatives, you can go long ('buy') if you think a cryptocurrency will rise in value or go short ('sell') if you think it will fall. By contrast, when you buy cryptocurrencies on an exchange, you buy the coins themselves. This requires you to create an exchange account, put up the full value of the asset to open a position, and store the cryptocurrency tokens in your own wallet until you're ready to sell. </p>
                        <p>Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, and for traders using leveraged derivatives that allow for both long and short positions, large and sudden price movements present opportunities for profit. However, at the same time, these movements also increase your exposure to risk. In short, the more volatile the market, the more risk you carry when trading it. </p>
                        <p> When trading cryptocurrencies with us, you can access real-time pricing. We derive our prices from several exchanges, and they're calculated on a continuous basis. Our prices are reflective of the underlying market, and because they are based on real markets in real time, they always reflect actual market sentiment. You can enter and exit positions quickly owing to tight spreads and our fast execution. We also provide a secure platform that you can utilize measures such as the two-factor authentication (2FA) to ensure you're secure when trading online. </p>
                        <p> In summary, trading cryptocurrencies with us via CFDs allows you to take advantage of the price movements of cryptocurrencies without the need to own the underlying assets. With our platform, you can access real-time pricing, enter and exit positions quickly, and trade on a secure platform. However, it's essential to note that trading cryptocurrencies carries risks, and you should always ensure you understand the risks involved before you start trading.  </p>

                        <h3 class="heading-5">Why is TechnoSavvy Called a Value Variance Inflationary Token?   </h3>
                        <p>The unique Automated Market Maker of the exchange ensures that all the trade on the platform will route through TechnoSavvy Tokens. It will create a demand for TechnoSavvy Tokens. Further, the token has a limited supply of 50 million tokens out of total 112.50 billion tokens. A total of 100 billion tokens will be locked in the TechnoApp ecosystem for the smooth functioning of the exchange.   </p>
                        <p> Each trade happening on TechnoApp will generate the demand for TechnoSavvy tokens. Thus, after each settled trade, the value of the TechnoSavvy token will inflate from the price before the trade. Thus, it is called a Value Variance Inflationary Token. This cycle works on the equation of limited supply and continuous demand.  </p>
                        <p>Every trade will contribute to the capital appreciation of the TechnoSavvy Token.  </p>
                        <h3 class="heading-5">Benefits of Investing in TechnoSavvy Token   </h3>
                        <p>TechnoSavvy Token is the backbone of TechnoApp Crypto Exchange. The utility token of the platform powers the next-generation trading engine of TechnoApp. Investing in TechnoSavvy token means owning a part of the world’s most rewarding crypto exchange. Investing in the native utility token of TechnoApp comes with its own benefits. Some of them are mentioned below:  </p>
                        <p><span>Cashback Rewards:   </span> TechnoApp offers you a cashback reward on every transaction. However, to avail yourself of these rewards, you must have at least 500 TechnoSavvy Tokens in your Earn Wallet. All the community members falling under this category are eligible for a cashback of up to 0.05% of the transaction value, which will be distributed among the Takers and Makers of the platform. Cashback earned by non-community members will be returned in the pool refund and will be utilized for the TechnoApp ecosystem.  </p>
                        <p><span>Zero Swap Fees   : </span> TechnoSavvy is the backbone of TechnoApp Crypto Exchange. By becoming a community member on TechnoApp, i.e., holding at least 500 TechnoSavvy tokens, you will be able to trade on the platform without paying any swap fees. The trading cost not only becomes zero but revenue positive due to cashback rewards.   </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Capital Appreciation: </span> All the transactions on the platform pass through its native utility token, TechnoSavvy. The token’s utility generates a continuous demand for the token with each settled trade. Further, as per the tokenomics, TechnoSavvy will have a limited supply of 50 million in the open market.  The equation of continuous demand and limited supply will result in exponential capital appreciation over a period of time. The trading mechanism of TechnoApp will benefit you in multiple ways. The cashback rewards offered on the platform will also be in TechnoSavvy tokens which means you can increase the value of your portfolio. Due to its incredible utility on the platform and the benefits of investing in TechnoSavvy, such as Cashback rewards and zero trading charges, more and more people will get attracted to TechnoSavvy. However, due to its
                            ed supply, a maximum of 100,000 holders will be able to be TechnoApp community members, making it a scarce investment.  This will further boost the value of TechnoSavvy Tokens resulting in capital appreciation.

                        <p> In a spot market, traders can immediately exchange their cryptocurrency for fiat currency or another cryptocurrency by placing a buy or sell order. </p>
                        <p> The base market, where crypto assets are instantaneously exchanged and settled, is known as a spot market, and trading in this market includes buying digital currencies like Bitcoin or other altcoins and holding them until their value rises. </p>
                        <p> It is called spot trading because the transactions are settled “on the spot.” Furthermore, spot markets include sellers, buyers and order books. Sellers make an order with a specific ask or sell price, and buyers place an order for any cryptocurrency token with a particular bid or purchase price. The bid price is the highest price that a buyer is ready to pay, and the ask price is the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept as payment. </p>
                        <p> The order book has two sides: The ask side for buyers eager to buy and the bid side for sellers willing to sell. The order book records bids and asks in the order book. For instance, in spot trading, if Bob makes an order to purchase BTC, this transaction will instantly go to the bid side of the order book. When a seller from the crypto spot trading platform is selling at the same specifications, this order is automatically filled. </p>
                        <p> The transaction continues to the ask side of the order book when Bob enters an order to sell BTC in the above crypto spot trading example. The orders in green in the order book reflect purchasers of a specific token, while the orders in red represent sellers of that token </p>
                        <p> The goal of spot trading is to buy low and sell high in order to make a profit, but it's not sure that this tactic will always work to the traders’ advantage considering the volatility of the crypto market. </p>
                        <p> The spot price, trade date and settlement date are the three crucial concepts in spot trading. The current price of any asset is called the spot price, and the traders can sell assets under consideration immediately at this price. Additionally, one can buy or sell cryptocurrencies with other users on various exchange platforms. </p>
                        <p> The spot price changes as new orders are placed and old ones are filled. The trade date initiates and records the transaction and represents the day the market actually carries out the trade. The assets involved in the transaction are actually transferred on the settlement date, also known as the spot date. </p>
                        <p> Depending on the sort of market being traded, there may be one day or several days between the trade date and the settlement date. For cryptocurrency, it usually happens on the same day, though it may differ among exchanges or trading platforms. </p>
                        <h5> Pros and cons of crypto spot trading </h5>
                        <p> When you purchase an asset at the spot price, one truly becomes the asset owner, allowing traders to sell it or relocate it to offline storage as they like. In addition, spot trading enables traders to use their cryptocurrency assets for additional functions like online payments or staking. </p>
                        <p> Moreover, spot trading is substantially less risky than margin trading, i.e., one can invest in crypto assets without worrying about losing money due to price changes and dealing with margin calls. As a result, the trader does not run the risk of contributing more of their own money or losing more money than they already have in their account because there are no margin calls. </p>
                        <p> However, the biggest drawback of spot trading is that it does not offer the advantage of any potential return amplification that leverage in margin trading might provide. Moreover, due to the absence of leverage, potential gains in the spot market are lower than those in margin trading. </p>

                            <li><span> Value: </span> The value field defines the value of the transaction in terms of the native token of that ecosystem. For example, if the transaction is on the Ethereum blockchain, the value field will be in Ether.  </li>
                            <li><span> swap fees: </span> The swap fees is the cost levied on the transaction for the miners to process it.

                        <p>A candlestick chart is a type of financial chart that graphically represents the price moves of an asset for a given timeframe.

The color of the candle indicates whether the asset's price is rising or falling. The default setting is a white background, where green candles (with black borders to make them visible against a white background) are up candles, indicating that the asset's price has risen during the given timeframe. In contrast, red candles are down candles, indicating that the asset's price has fallen during the given timeframe. </p>

                        <p>
                            In candlestick charts, the body of the candle represents the difference between the opening and closing prices for the given time period. The top and bottom of the body indicate the opening and closing prices respectively. When the closing price is higher than the opening price, the candle is typically colored green, indicating a bullish trend. Conversely, when the closing price is lower than the opening price, the candle is usually colored red, indicating a bearish trend.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The wick or shadow of the candlestick represents the highest and lowest price for the given time period. The upper wick represents the highest price reached during that period, while the lower wick represents the lowest price. The length of the wick indicates the range of price movement and the volatility of the market during that time period.
                        </p>
                        <p>Traders often use candlestick charts to identify specific formations, such as the doji, hammer, and shooting star patterns, which can indicate potential changes in trend direction. By analyzing candlestick patterns, traders can make informed decisions about when to enter or exit trades.  </p>

                        <h5>Understanding Your Orders  </h5>
                        <p>When trading in the cryptocurrency market, it is important to have a good understanding of the various types of orders you can place and the information associated with them. In this article, we will take a closer look at some of the common order types and the information you can expect to see in your order history and trade history. </p>

                        <p><span> Spot Order: </span> A spot order is a type of order that is executed immediately at the current market price. It is commonly used in trading and investing to buy or sell an asset on the spot market. The spot market is where financial instruments, such as stocks, currencies, and commodities, are traded for immediate delivery or settlement.  </p>
                        <p>When you place a spot order, you specify the amount of the asset you want to trade, and whether you want to buy or sell it. The order is then executed immediately, based on the prevailing market price. This means that the trade is settled instantly, and the asset is transferred from the seller to the buyer.  </p>
                        <p> Spot orders are commonly used in daily trading or short-term trading strategies, where the trader is looking to take advantage of short-term price movements in the market. They are also used by investors who want to buy or sell an asset quickly, without having to wait for a specific price or market condition. </p>


                        <p> <span> Open Order:  </span> An open order is an order that has been placed on the market but has not yet been executed. When a trader places an open order, it is added to the order book and remains there until it is matched with a counter order that satisfies its conditions or until it is cancelled by the trader. </p>
                        <p>Open orders are usually used to set a target price at which the trader wants to buy or sell an asset in the future. </p>
                        <p>For example, if a trader wants to buy a certain cryptocurrency when its price drops to a certain level, they can place an open order with that specific price level. Once the price of the asset reaches that level, the open order will be executed automatically. Until that happens, the open order will remain in the order book waiting to be filled by a matching order. </p>

                        <p><span> Order History: </span>Order history is a record of all the orders that have been placed, modified, cancelled, or executed on an exchange. The order history section typically displays a list of all the orders a trader has placed and their current status. This information is important for traders to keep track of their trading activity and to analyze their performance over time. </p>
                        <p>The order history section typically includes details such as the order ID, timestamp, order type (buy or sell), order status (open, filled, cancelled), and other relevant information such as the amount and price at which the order was placed. Traders can use this information to track the progress of their orders, to see which orders have been filled, which have been cancelled, and to analyze their trading behavior.  </p>
                        <p>Order history can be useful for traders in many ways. For example, it can help traders to identify patterns in their trading behavior, to see which types of orders are most successful, and to analyze the effectiveness of their trading strategies. Additionally, order history can be used to track the performance of individual trades, to see how much profit or loss was made on each trade, and to identify areas where improvements can be made.  </p>

                        <p><span> Trade History : </span> Trade history is a section that displays all the executed trades that a user has made in the past. It includes details such as the unique trade ID, timestamp, order type, amount, price, and fee associated with each trade. It provides a complete record of all the transactions made by the user and can be useful for keeping track of profits and losses. The trade history section can also provide insights into a user's trading behavior, allowing them to identify patterns and improve their trading strategy. </p>

                        <h5>Conclusion </h5>
                        <p>Understanding your orders is crucial when trading in the cryptocurrency market. By knowing the different types of orders you can place, and the information associated with them, you can make informed decisions and manage your trades more effectively. Be sure to check your order history and trade history regularly to keep track of your trades and monitor your progress. </p>

                        <p>Traders mostly use Market orders where they want to trade on immediate basis without the limitation of desired price. If trader think that the current market price will quickly move against their favorable price, i.e., if they think price will move up anytime, and user wants to buy it irrespective of price limit, he will likely place Market Buy Order; if they think price will move down anytime, and user wants to sell it irrespective of price limit, he will likely place Market Sell Order. During extreme volatile market users place these orders.  </p>
                        <p> On the selection of Market Order section, option to put Price will be disabled. Trader needs to specify the desired amount or desired Value of such Market order, which will be filled according to the traded price. Execution is almost assured on immediate basis subject to the availability of the counter party.   </p>

                        <img src="~/images/What-Is-Wallet.png" alt="image">
                        <p> A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital wallet used to store digital codes that are necessary for sending and receiving cryptocurrency assets. There are several types of wallets available, including funding wallets, spot wallets, earn wallets, and margin wallets. In this article, we will discuss each of these wallets in detail.  </p>
                        <p><span>Funding Wallet: </span>
                        <p>A funding wallet is a type of cryptocurrency wallet where you can store your fiat and cryptocurrency funds securely. This wallet is specifically designed to hold the funds that you will be using for trading or making transactions on an exchange platform. The funding wallet usually supports several crypto and fiat currencies, which makes it easier for you to deposit, withdraw, and trade different types of assets. </p>
                        <p>Once you have deposited funds into your funding wallet, you can use them to transfer or exchange to other wallets within the exchange platform. You can also withdraw your cryptocurrency to your bank account or other external wallets.</p>
                        <p>It is important to note that the funding wallet is usually the first wallet you use to deposit funds to your exchange account. Once you have funded your account, you can then transfer the funds to your other wallets or use them for trading.</p>

                        <p><span> Spot Wallet: </span>A spot wallet is a type of cryptocurrency wallet where you can store your digital assets for a short-term period before executing any trades. When you open an account with a cryptocurrency exchange, you will typically receive a spot wallet automatically.  </p>
                        <p> This wallet is used to hold your assets until you decide to sell or transfer them. You can also use the assets in your spot wallet to trade on the exchange platform. The balance in your spot wallet reflects the amount of cryptocurrency you currently hold that has not been used for any trades.   </p>

                        <p><span> Earn Wallet: </span>  An earn wallet is a type of cryptocurrency wallet that is used to store rewards earned from various activities on an exchange platform. These rewards can be in the form of cashback, giveaways, airdrops, interest on staking, and more. The earn wallet is linked to the exchange platform, and the rewards are deposited directly into the wallet. </p>
                        <p> For example, if an exchange offers a cashback reward for trading a certain amount of cryptocurrency, the cashback reward will be deposited directly into the earn wallet. Similarly, if an exchange offers a staking reward for holding a certain cryptocurrency in your account, the staking rewards will be deposited directly into the earn wallet. </p>
                        <p>The earn wallet is a great way to earn passive income on your cryptocurrency assets. By keeping your assets in an earning wallet, you can earn rewards without actively trading or managing your investments. However, it is important to note that the rewards earned in the earn wallet may be subject to taxes and regulations, and it is important to understand the tax implications of earning rewards on your cryptocurrency investments.  </p>

                        <p> <span>Margin Wallet: </span>

                        <p>A margin wallet is a special type of cryptocurrency wallet that enables traders to buy or sell more cryptocurrency than the amount they currently have in their wallet. This is achieved by transferring funds from their funding wallet to their margin wallet and borrowing additional funds with a borrowing fee. </p>
                        <p> Leverage trading is the practice of using borrowed funds to increase the potential returns on an investment. By using a margin wallet, a trader can effectively magnify their trading positions and potentially earn higher profits than they would with their existing funds alone. </p>
                        <p>However, it's important to note that trading with leverage can also amplify potential losses, so it should be approached with caution and proper risk management strategies.</p>
                        <p>Once the leverage trading is complete, the trader can then move their funds back to their funding wallet. This allows them to return any borrowed funds and fees and ensure that their original investment remains intact. </p>
                        <h5>Conclusion </h5>
                        <p>In conclusion, understanding the different types of wallets and their functions is important when dealing with cryptocurrency assets. It is essential to choose the right wallet based on your requirements and goals. </p>

                        <p>At TechnoApp, we believe in rewarding our community members for trading on our exchange. That's why we offer a cashback program to all our traders.</p>
                        <p>TechnoApp rewards its Community Members with Cashback of up to 0.05% of the transaction value, which is distributed between the Takers and Makers, &#64; 60% and 40%, respectively.</p>
                        <p>If you trade on TechnoApp, you are eligible to receive a cashback benefit. The total cashback offered is distributed between Makers and Takers. A Maker is a trader who adds liquidity to the market, while a Taker is a trader who removes liquidity from the market.</p>
                        <p>Out of the total cashback offered, 60% is provided to Takers and 40% is provided to Makers. </p>
                        <div class="border-sec ex-sec">
                            <p><span> For example: </span></p>
                            <p> if the total cashback offered is $20, Takers will receive $12 (60% of $20) and Makers will receive $8 (40% of $20).</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>To receive the cashback benefit, all you have to do is trade on TechnoApp. The more you trade, the more cashback you can earn! </p>

                        <h5>Who is this cashback for? </h5>
                        <p>TechnoApp offers a cashback program to incentivize All community members for trading on platform. This means that if you trade on TechnoApp, you can receive a certain percentage of the fees you pay in the form of cashback. </p>
                        <p>In this case, TechnoApp distributes the total cashback benefit between two types of traders: Makers and Takers. </p>
                        <p>A "maker" is a trader who adds liquidity to the market by placing limit orders on the order book, while a "taker" is a trader who removes liquidity from the market by taking orders off the order book. </p>
                        <p>Out of the total cashback offered, 60% is given to Takers and 40% to Makers. </p>
                        <div class="border-sec ex-sec">
                            <p><span> For example: </span></p>
                            <p>   So, if the total cashback offered is $20, $12 (60% of $20) will be given to Takers and $8 (40% of $20) will be given to Makers.   </p>
                        </div>

                        <p>Therefore, if you are a Taker and you trade on TechnoApp, you will receive a cashback of $12 for the trading fees you pay on the exchange. If you are a Maker, you will receive a cashback of $8 for the trading fees you pay on the exchange. </p>
                        <h5>Cashback Calculation </h5>
                        <p>TechnoApp rewards its Community Members with Cashback of up to 0.05% of the transaction value, which is distributed between the Takers and Makers, &#64; 60% and 40%, respectively. Yes, Takers are given more.</p>
                        <p>Let’s understand it through an example:</p>
                        <div class="border-sec ex-sec">
                            <p>If a transaction of $100,000 happens on TechnoApp, Takers can get a cashback of $30 TechnoSavvy ($100,000 * 0.05% * 60%).</p>
                            <p>Cashback for Makers on the exchange will be $20 worth of TechnoSavvy ($100,000 * 0.05% * 40%).</p>

                        <p>At TechnoApp, we understand that trading can sometimes result in losses, which is why we offer a unique cashback program that can help make your trades positive, even if you sell your digital assets at a limited loss. </p>
                        <div class="border-sec ex-sec">
                            <p> Let's take a look at an example to better understand how our cashback program works: </p>

                            <p>Suppose a trader buys Bitcoin for $21,000 and sells it for $20,999. The loss incurred in this trade is only $1. </p>

                            <p>However, with TechnoApp's cashback program, the trader can earn a cashback of $21, which is 0.10% of the sale price. </p>

                            <p>This means that the trader actually made a profit of $20, even though they sold the Bitcoin at a loss. </p>
                        </div>
                        <p>This is just one example of how TechnoApp's cashback program can help traders mitigate their losses and even turn them into profits. By offering a generous cashback program, we aim to incentivize traders to trade more frequently on our platform and increase liquidity on the exchange. </p>
                        <p>So, if you want to trade with confidence, knowing that even if you sell your digital assets at a limited loss, you can still earn a profit, then TechnoApp is the platform for you. </p>

                        <p> TechnoSavvy Token is the primary token used on the TechnoApp exchange platform. This means that every trade made on TechnoApp, regardless of which cryptocurrency is being traded, will be processed using TechnoSavvy Token [i.e., Each trade on the TechnoApp will be routed through TechnoSavvy Token only].</p>
                        <p> As a result, the demand for TechnoSavvy Token will increase, as traders will need to hold the token to use the exchange. This increased demand will result in a rise in the value of the TechnoSavvy Token, known as capital appreciation.</p>
                        <p>The more trades made on TechnoApp, the higher the demand for TechnoSavvy Token, and consequently, the higher the token's value appreciation. This is because more trades mean more users needing TechnoSavvy Token to use the exchange, driving up the demand for the token.</p>
                        <p>In summary, the exclusive use of TechnoSavvy Token on TechnoApp will drive up the demand for the token, leading to capital appreciation as the token captures the cryptocurrency pair trading values on the platform.</p>

                        <p>Arbitrage trading is a popular strategy among traders who look for price discrepancies between different exchanges to make a profit. In the case of cryptocurrency, the price of a particular token can vary across different exchanges due to differences in supply and demand, trading volume, and other factors. Traders can exploit these price differences by buying low on one exchange and selling high on another.</p>
                        <p>At TechnoApp, we offer an excellent opportunity for traders to engage in arbitrage trading. Our Next-Generation cryptocurrency exchange provides cashback benefits on every transaction, allowing traders to find arbitrage opportunities despite the impact cost. With TechnoApp, traders can buy and sell crypto with confidence, knowing they can take advantage of any price differences between exchanges.</p>
                        <p>For example, let's say a trader buys bitcoin for $25,000 on one exchange and sells it for $24,999 on another exchange. The trader incurs a loss of $1 in this trade. However, with TechnoApp's cashback benefit of up to 0.10% of the transaction volume, the trader can earn back $25 (24,999*0.10%). As a result, the total profit made by the trader in this trade would be $24 ($25 - $1).</p>
                        <p>By trading on TechnoApp, the impact cost is reduced, and that creates an arbitrage opportunity for you. Our exchange is designed to offer traders the best possible trading experience, with advanced security features, low swap fees, and high liquidity.

                        <p>
                            Liquidity in the market means how easily you can sell off your cryptocurrency or how easily you can swap one crypto token for another. An extensive liquidity pool provides a sufficient number of traders ready to buy and sell their tokens. As the number of traders increases, the spread between the bid and ask orders becomes narrow.
                            <br>
                            This provides the most appropriate selling and buying price to the sellers and buyers, respectively.  The more traders on the platform, the higher the liquidity will be.
                        </p>

                        <p><span>How does Liquidity Impact the Trade Profit?</span> </p>
                        <p>The lack of liquidity in the market increases Bid-Ask Spread. “Bid" means the price a trader is ready to pay, and "Ask” is the price a seller is willing to sell the asset at. The difference between the best bid and best ask is called Bid and Ask Spread. </p>
                        <p>
                            Higher liquidity reduces the difference between Bid and Ask orders. This diminution creates a healthy market and provides the most adequate price for buyers and sellers.
                            Liquidity is a major contributor to long-term profitability.

                            TechnoApp, the innovative cryptocurrency exchange, boasts a one-of-a-kind trading engine design that sets it apart from other exchanges in the market. When you trade on TechnoApp, you'll notice that you receive only 99.98% of the asset you've just acquired. While this may seem like a minor reduction, it's all part of our system designed to reward and incentivize community participation.
                            <br>
                            Here's how it works:
                        </p>

                        <p><span>TechnoSavvy Token as the Core:</span> </p>
                        <p>At the heart of TechnoApp's trading engine is TechnoSavvy Token (TechnoSavvy). Every trade on the exchange is routed through TechnoSavvy, making it an integral part of the trading process.  </p>


                        <p><span>The Trade Engine: </span> </p>
                        <p>When you initiate a trade on TechnoApp, the trade engine first executes a trade with TechnoSavvy. It temporarily holds 0.02% of the total TechnoSavvy, and after holding this small portion, the rest is converted into the asset you desire. This conversion explains the slight reduction in the asset you receive. </p>
                        <p><span>Cashback for Community Members:</span></p>
                        <p>Here's where TechnoApp's community-centric approach truly shines. The remaining 0.02% of TechnoSavvy, which wasn't used in your trade, isn't lost or wasted. Instead, it, along with rewards generated from capital appreciation due to the trade, is awarded to you as cashback. </p>


                        <p><span>Community Benefits:</span></p>
                        <p>It's important to highlight that this cashback is a unique feature available exclusively to TechnoApp community members. If you're an active member of the TechnoApp community, you'll enjoy the benefit of this cashback, which can add up significantly over time. </p>

                        <p><span>Non-Community Members: </span></p>
                        <p>If you're not a part of the TechnoApp community. Your 0.02% of TechnoSavvy, as well as any associated rewards, are transferred to the community pool. This pool is designed to benefit the TechnoApp community as a whole. So, if you're not the community member, you are not eligible for this reward. </p>
                        <p>In essence, TechnoApp's trading engine is not only efficient but also community oriented. It encourages active participation by rewarding community members with cashback, while non-community members indirectly support the community's growth. This unique system sets TechnoApp apart as an exchange that not only facilitates cryptocurrency trading but also fosters a thriving, engaged community of users.  </p>
                        <p>So, whether you're a seasoned trader or just getting started, TechnoApp has something special to offer for everyone. Join the community and experience the benefits of this exceptional exchange for yourself. </p>

                            <h3>Automated Market Maker (AMM)  </h3>

                            <img src="~/images/amm1.png" alt="image">
                            <p>An Automated Market Maker (AMM) is a mechanism often used in Decentralized Exchanges that eliminates the need for a traditional order book. Instead, it utilizes an algorithmic model that determines the prices of assets based on the supply and demand of the token pair being traded. </p>
                            <p> AMMs function by creating a liquidity pool, which is a reserve of cryptocurrency tokens that are used to facilitate trades on the exchange. The liquidity pool acts as a counterparty to all trades, and the prices of tokens are calculated by the exchange based on the current ratio of tokens in the pool.</p>
                            <p> When a user wants to trade a token pair, they deposit the tokens into the liquidity pool, and the pool automatically sets the exchange rate based on the ratio of tokens in the pool. The user receives an equivalent amount of the other token in the pair based on the exchange rate. </p>
                            <p> AMMs provide several benefits over traditional centralized exchanges, including increased liquidity, reduced fees, and lower barriers to entry for new tokens. They also enable users to trade without relying on a centralized exchange operator, which can reduce the risk of censorship or fraud. </p>

                            <h5>How is AMM used in TechnoApp?  </h5>
                            <p>TechnoApp is a next-generation cryptocurrency exchange that has implemented AMM to improve liquidity and facilitate trading. The exchange uses a unique AMM algorithm that allows for seamless and efficient trading of various digital assets.</p>

                            <p> One of the key benefits of TechnoApp's AMM implementation is that it eliminates the need for market makers, thereby reducing costs for both the exchange and traders. The AMM algorithm dynamically adjusts the price of assets based on supply and demand, ensuring that the exchange always has sufficient liquidity. This also means that traders can easily buy or sell any cryptocurrency listed on the exchange without worrying about the availability of market makers.</p>

                            <p>TechnoApp's AMM also enables the exchange to support a wide range of tokens, including those that may not have sufficient liquidity to be listed on traditional exchanges. By allowing anyone to add liquidity to the pool, TechnoApp has created a more inclusive trading environment that benefits both traders and token issuers. </p>

                            <p>Furthermore, TechnoApp's AMM implementation is designed to be highly scalable, allowing the exchange to handle large trading volumes without sacrificing performance. This is especially important in a market where cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly popular, and trading volumes can fluctuate rapidly.</p>

                            <p>TechnoApp has also implemented other innovative features to enhance the trading experience, such as real-time settlement, which ensures that trades are settled instantly, and a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for traders to buy and sell digital assets.</p>

                            <p>In conclusion, TechnoApp's implementation of AMM has transformed the traditional cryptocurrency exchange model, providing traders with a more efficient, inclusive, and scalable trading platform. With its commitment to innovation and user experience, TechnoApp is well-positioned to become a leading player in the cryptocurrency exchange industry. </p>

                            <h5> Basic Definitions</h5>
                            <p>KYC (Know Your Customer) is a process that banks, financial institutions, and crypto exchanges use to gather personal information from customers. The primary objective of KYC is to prevent fraudulent activities like money laundering, identity theft, and terrorism financing. </p>
                            <p>KYC is a crucial step in combating financial crimes and maintaining the integrity of the financial system. By collecting identifying information and documents, financial institutions can ensure that their customers are legitimate and that their transactions are legal. </p>
                            <p>Some of the identifying documents that are typically required by KYC processes include:  </p>
                            <p> <span>Driver’s License/Government-issued photo ID:</span>  A driver's license or other government-issued photo ID is a common document used for KYC. This document is used to verify the identity of the individual and to confirm their current residential address. </p>
                            <p><span>Passport:</span> A passport is another widely accepted document for KYC purposes. It is a reliable form of identification that can be used to confirm the individual's identity and citizenship. </p>
                            <p><span>TAX ID card:</span> Tax ID card is a unique tax identifier assigned to individuals. It is a widely used document for KYC purposes and is required for many financial transactions in India. </p>
                            <p><span>Voter ID Card:</span> A Voter ID Card is a document issued by the Election Commission. It serves as proof of identity and is widely accepted for KYC purposes.  </p>
                            <p>Completing the KYC process can be a hassle, but it is an essential step in ensuring the safety and security of financial transactions. By verifying the identity of customers and ensuring that their transactions are legitimate, financial institutions can protect themselves and their customers from fraudulent activities. </p>
                            <h5> Why is KYC Mandatory for Most Crypto Exchanges?  </h5>
                            <p>Cryptocurrency exchanges are digital platforms where users can buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many others. As these platforms deal with financial transactions, it is crucial to maintain a high level of security and compliance to avoid fraudulent activities.</p>
                            <p>KYC refers to the process of verifying the identity of customers to prevent money laundering, terrorism financing, and other illicit activities. The KYC process typically involves collecting personal information such as name, address, date of birth, and government-issued identification documents. </p>
                            <p>Most countries have regulations that require financial institutions, including cryptocurrency exchanges, to implement KYC procedures. These regulations are in place to ensure that exchanges comply with the law and are transparent in their operations.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, KYC is an essential tool for tracking transaction patterns and identifying suspicious behavior. By collecting customer data, exchanges can identify users who may be engaged in illegal activities and report them to the authorities. </p>
                            <p>In addition, KYC helps protect cryptocurrency exchanges from legal liability. Without KYC verification, exchanges may be held responsible for any illegal activities that their customers engage in. By implementing KYC procedures, exchanges can show that they have done their due diligence and are not complicit in any illegal activities.</p>
                            <p>It is important to note that KYC is different from AML. While KYC is focused on verifying the identity of customers, AML is focused on preventing money laundering and other financial crimes. KYC is just one part of a broader AML compliance program that also includes transaction monitoring and reporting suspicious activities.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, KYC is mandatory for most cryptocurrency exchanges because it helps ensure compliance with regulatory rules and laws, protects exchanges from legal liability, and prevents illicit activities. While the process of collecting personal information may be inconvenient for some users, it is a necessary step to ensure the safety and security of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. </p>

                            <p>Anti-money laundering (AML) is a critical component of modern financial regulation, aimed at preventing illegal activities such as tax evasion, public corruption, and market manipulation through the movement of illicit funds. AML laws and regulations are designed to protect the integrity of financial institutions, promote transparency in financial transactions, and deter criminals from exploiting the financial system.</p>
                            <p>One of the primary mechanisms of AML is Know Your Customer (KYC), which requires financial institutions to verify the identity of their customers and assess the risks associated with their transactions.

                            <p>Modern KYC procedures are heavily automated, and many institutions use the client onboarding process as an opportunity to acquire proper identification from new customers. This process involves collecting relevant personal and financial information from customers, such as their name, address, and source of income. Financial institutions also monitor their users' activity on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance with AML laws and regulations. </p>
                            <p>AML laws and regulations are constantly evolving to keep pace with the changing nature of financial crime. In recent years, there has been increased focus on the use of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets for illicit purposes. Financial institutions are increasingly required to implement advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect and prevent financial crime.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, AML and KYC are critical components of modern financial regulation, aimed at preventing the movement of illicit funds and protecting the integrity of financial institutions. As criminals become more sophisticated in their methods, it is essential that financial institutions remain vigilant and continue to adapt their AML and KYC procedures to stay ahead of the evolving threats. </p>

                            <p>TechnoApp, like many other cryptocurrency exchanges, is subject to various regulatory restrictions that prevent it from operating in certain countries. The reasons for exclusion from a country can be diverse, including a lack of regulation, transparency, or outright bans on cryptocurrency trading.</p>
                            <p>Many countries do not have clear regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrency exchanges, making it difficult for TechnoApp to operate there. In some cases, governments have banned or prohibited advertising from cryptocurrency exchanges altogether. This lack of regulation and oversight can create an environment where investors are at risk of losing all their money, making it difficult for TechnoApp to operate in such countries.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, TechnoApp operates with transparency and provides clear warnings about the risks associated with crypto trading. However, some regulators may still believe that these warnings are insufficient, leading to restrictions on exchange services in certain countries. </p>
                            <p>In addition, some countries have outright banned cryptocurrency trading, and TechnoApp is prohibited from operating in those jurisdictions. Some of these countries include China, Algeria, Bolivia, Burundi, and Iraq. </p>
                            <p>It is important to note that TechnoApp reserves the right to close accounts at its sole discretion, meaning that accounts can be closed at any time, for any reason.

                            <p>In conclusion, TechnoApp operates under various regulatory restrictions, preventing it from operating in some countries.
