It's also worth noting that the referral reward may be subject to certain conditions, such as the preferred user completing a certain number of trades or meeting other specific criteria. If you have any concerns about the status of your referral reward or need assistance with the referral process, you can contact TechnoApp's customer support team for help.

                                                            <p> Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is designed to operate as a medium of exchange using cryptography for security. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies operate independently of a central bank or government. Transactions with cryptocurrencies are recorded on a decentralized public ledger called a blockchain, which ensures transparency and security of the transactions.</p>
                                                            <p> The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, hundreds of other cryptocurrencies have been developed, each with its own unique features and use cases. </p>
                                                            <p>  Cryptocurrencies are often used for online transactions, and their popularity has grown rapidly over the past decade. They are used for various purposes such as buying goods and services, investment, and trading on crypto exchanges. Some cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Litecoin have even been designed to facilitate smart contracts and decentralized applications. </p>
                                                            <p> One of the main advantages of cryptocurrencies is their decentralized nature, which means that they are not subject to the control of any government or financial institution. This also makes them immune to inflation and corruption, which is a major concern with traditional currencies. </p>
                                                            <p> However, cryptocurrencies are also subject to market volatility, and their value can fluctuate widely over a short period of time. This makes them a high-risk investment, and investors should be cautious when investing in them. </p>
                                                            <p> Overall, cryptocurrencies represent a new and exciting development in the world of finance and technology, and their potential for disrupting traditional financial systems is immense. </p>

While it can increase potential profits, it can also increase potential losses. Traders should always make sure they fully understand the risks involved in margin trading before using this feature. Additionally, it's important to keep track of the borrowed funds and repay them promptly to avoid additional fees and potential liquidation of assets. </p>

                                                            <p>A Maker on a cryptocurrency exchange is a trader who places a limit order on the order book, instead of a market order. Limit orders allow the trader to specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell a cryptocurrency rather than accepting the current market price. When a limit order is executed, it adds liquidity to the exchange by providing an opportunity for other traders to trade with the maker at a specific price. As a result, makers typically receive a small rebate or reduced trading fees as an incentive for providing liquidity to the exchange. In contrast, traders who place market orders, which are executed immediately at the best available price, are referred to as Takers and they take liquidity from the order book. </p>
                                                            <p>In addition to receiving incentives for providing liquidity, makers may also have more control over the execution price of their trades. Since limit orders are executed only when the market price reaches the specified limit price, makers have the opportunity to trade at a more favorable price than if they had placed a market order. This can be especially useful in volatile markets where prices can fluctuate rapidly. </p>
                                                            <p> Makers can also use limit orders to set up automated trading strategies. By placing multiple limit orders at different price levels, makers can create a trading bot that automatically buys or sells cryptocurrency when the market reaches a certain price point. This can be a useful tool for traders who want to take advantage of market movements without constantly monitoring the exchange. </p>

                                                            <p>IOC stands for "Immediate or Cancel" order. It is a type of order in cryptocurrency trading that requires the entire order to be executed immediately, or any unfilled portion of the order is cancelled. IOC orders are often used by traders who want to ensure that their trades are executed as quickly as possible, and they do not want to leave any open orders on the order book. An IOC order ensures that a trader's entire order will either be filled at the best available price or will be cancelled if there is not enough liquidity to fill the entire order. This type of order is different from a limit order, which allows the order to remain on the order book until it is either filled or cancelled by the trader.</p>
                                                            <p>IOC orders are commonly used in situations where a trader wants to execute a large order quickly and does not want to risk leaving any portion of the order unfilled. Since an IOC order is either filled immediately or cancelled, it can be useful for avoiding slippage, which is the difference between the expected price of an order and the actual price at which it is filled. Slippage can occur when the market moves against a trader while they are waiting for an order to be filled, causing them to receive a worse price than they anticipated. By using an IOC order, a trader can reduce their exposure to slippage and ensure that their trades are executed quickly and efficiently. </p>

It involves placing two conditional orders simultaneously, where the execution of one order automatically cancels the other. For example, a trader might place a stop order to sell a cryptocurrency if its price falls below a certain level, while also placing a limit order to sell the same cryptocurrency at a higher price. If the stop order is triggered and the cryptocurrency is sold, the limit order is automatically cancelled. Similarly, if the limit order is triggered, the stop order is cancelled. This type of order is useful for traders who want to manage their risk and protect their profits by having multiple exit strategies in place. </p>

This is done to avoid revealing the full size of the order to the market, which could potentially impact the price of the asset being traded. Each smaller part of the order is known as an "iceberg," and only the tip of the iceberg, or the visible portion of the order, is displayed to the market. As each visible part of the order is filled, another hidden part is revealed and added to the order book. Iceberg orders are often used by large institutional investors who want to avoid slippage and minimize the market impact of their trades.

While an Iceberg order allows a trader to hide a large order by breaking it into smaller ones, an AON order requires that the entire order be filled in one go or not at all. A trader may use an AON order when they want to make sure they get the entire order filled at the desired price, instead of only getting a portion of the order filled. AON orders are commonly used in situations where the trader wants to avoid partial fills, such as in high volatility markets where the price can move rapidly.

In the case of cryptocurrency, day trading involves buying and selling cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, within a single trading day. Day traders aim to take advantage of price movements by opening and closing multiple positions throughout the day, hoping to make a profit from the small price changes that occur. Day trading requires discipline, technical analysis, and a thorough understanding of market trends to be successful. It can be a high-risk strategy due to the potential for large losses if the market moves against the trader.</p>

The goal of swing trading is to profit from the price movements that occur between the support and resistance levels of a cryptocurrency. Swing traders use technical analysis to identify potential entry and exit points, and they often use indicators such as moving averages, oscillators, and trend lines to help them make trading decisions. Unlike day traders, swing traders do not have to monitor the markets constantly, which makes it a popular trading style for those with a full-time job or other commitments. Swing trading requires a bit more patience than day trading but can potentially offer larger returns. </p>
